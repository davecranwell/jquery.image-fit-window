Image Fit Window
================

A small jQuery plugin to automatically resize important content images to fit within the browser window. You can also have it fit images to any other container besides the window, but the uses for this are few.

It was inspired by the behaviour of the artwork images on Artsy.net (e.g http://artsy.net/artwork/shepard-fairey-power-and-glory-iv) and is intended to fulfil a very similar role. 

On art-focused websites it's often important that an image be visible in its entirety to be properly appreciated. As websites are often fluid-width and browser dimensions up to the user, it can be tricky to ensure an image is always fully visible while also scaled appropriately, without mushing one of the dimensions.

This plugin is essentially solely aimed at fiting an image within the browser window.
